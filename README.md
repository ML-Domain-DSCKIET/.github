## About DSC KIET:
Developer Student Circuit is an initiative to help students to grow their knowledge on developer technologies and more through peer to peer workshops and events, and gain relevant industry experience.

DSC is a community to support you in learning, so if you have the dedication to learn you have it all, and we welcome you to our community. We try to engage student developers through our hack, events, codelabs, and meetups.

The motive is to create an ecosystem of programmers & developers in the campus by helping them to learn and build projects. We are working on various domains such as Machine Learning, AR-VR, Web development, Android Development and Competitive Programming.

## ML Domain:
* #### Machine Learning:
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. Over the last couple of decades, the technological advances in storage and processing power have enabled some innovative products based on machine learning, such as Netflixâ€™s recommendation engine and self-driving cars.

Machine Learning is one of the domains in the *DSC KIET*. A group of Machine Learning Enthusiast independent of their branch works together on various Machien Learning and deep learning algorithmns in order to make projects.
