# DSC KIET ML Domain

Welcome to the ML Domain of DSC KIET, a community of machine learning enthusiasts who are dedicated to learning ML and building AI applications. Our student development team is enthusiastic about learning about the latest trends and breakthroughs in the field of machine learning and applying this knowledge to create new projects.

## What Do We Do?

At DSC KIET, we strive to create an ecosystem of programmers and developers on our campus by helping them learn and build projects. We achieve this by organizing hackathons, events, codelabs, and meetups to engage student developers and provide them with opportunities to showcase their skills and learn from experts in the field.
Our community is enthusiastic about machine learning, and we encourage members to share their ideas and projects with the rest of the community. We believe that collaboration is key to success, and we welcome everyone who is interested in ML to join us and become part of our community.
